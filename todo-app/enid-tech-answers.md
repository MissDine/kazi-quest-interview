I took 7 hours to complete the project
I spent more time working on the functionality.Nothing was so difficult oly that I feel I could do better
The most useful feature that was added to vue.js is the use of components, this is so elpful because modularization helps in tracking down an issue in case of a breakdown and also it is easy handling each component independently
I tracked down the performance issue in production by checking the space my app occupied and the time it took  to run.I ensured that my app takes the minimumm space by writing dry code and also runs fast
So far all was well
